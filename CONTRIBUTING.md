# Contributing a GDPR casualty

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

* We prefer an timestamped blog post or news article archived at <a href="http://archive.is/">archive.is</a>. 
* When contributing a casualty, we like these common descriptions:

  - `Closing globally`: The company has completely halted operations, usually due to being located in the EU
  - `Closing EU operations`: The company was located in the EU and has shut down operations there. 
  - `Blocking EU visitors`: The company is not located in the EU and has begun blocking EU-based IP addresses.
